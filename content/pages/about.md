So, this is my site. I'm currently writing my Master's thesis
at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de) on recurrent neural
networks for machine translation. I'm generally interested
in data science (machine learning, artificial intelligence, algorithms
etc...), cryptocurrency, and of course GNU/Linux. On the bottom of this page,
you can find some pointers in case you want to get in touch.

I usually sign my mails using [this key](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xBE59A8D5E55F9288).
